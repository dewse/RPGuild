

Brainstorm:

  Decide how stand-alone program will be. If focus is on portability for popular
programs like Discord. Decide if we want to run C++ or HTML5. If HTML5 can support
all the functions we want to implement, then it will be so.

MODULES
____________________________________________________________
~~ LAND CLAIMS ~~
  Guild land ownership coordination, interacts with other users with addon/app to
show on map. potential 10x10 px avatar. If player is the GM of a guild, app will
recognize that and allow them to set this land claim. BIG potential here if we
run with idea

Startup APP? Use this single feature to launch the rest of the app. If they enjoyed
this, we just MOTD of the full APP.

To streamline, could have interface of map and players on APP itself instead
of relying on the in-game resources.
This will allow for the APP itself to comm with other user's APP and not
have to rely on LUA comm.

If possible, then overlay like discord.

King of the Hill event triggered by schedule OR guild fed [Using credits]

Wpvp-oriented

Can work on same concept as TRP3 and show guild icons on the map. May be too
cluttered if it showed everyone. Maybe high rank, or no player movement.
_____________________________________________________________
~~ BANK & RESOURCES ~~
  Interact with bank. Screenshot, or mouse-over to inventory. Shoots return to collective add-on.
    -Can view (snapshotted) gbank out of game.
    -Can also set expected inventory on items for refill or guild turn-in.
    Discord webhooks potential.

~~ RP WIKI ~~
  RP Wiki embedded or plug-in to existing web-app module (i.e. Enjin, Wikimedia, etc.)

~~ POINT SYSTEM ~~
  Allow easy seamless experience that gives power to distribute points to guildies
  to later be redeemed for anything (think gear from raids, resources from bank,
  priority for limited events, etc). APP recognizes content and person sent to,
  or appointed individuals with persmission can input. The more auto it is, the
  better.

  Points could expand to guilds as well. Think of way that guilds could build
  their rep or points. Points then can be used to trigger events like the King
  of the Hill, or guild bounty another guild.
____________________________________________________________
~~ GUILD INFO DATABASE ~~
For RP guilds that don't want to have a hosted website. This will allow lots of
info to be displayed (within reason), but would require paid hosting or income.
This would also allow a quick peak into a guild without having to look up their
guild. Ultimately, getting a database of all the guilds that exist on the realm
and have some sort of interaction with the database. Tagging definers. Guilds
opening bounties for others to know.

~~ PLAYER DATABASE ~~
Same as above, but on a player database. This will be a lot heavier if we add this.
It would be amazing, but requires an immense database and hosting if the info is
big, and beyond text.

Personal Stats against other players.
- Arch-Nemesis (Player has killed you a lot)
- Nemesis (Player has had a lot of fights against you (win or loss))
- Ally (Player has fought along side of you)
- Friend (Player has fought many times along side you)

~~ BOUNTY BOARD ~~
This board will publicly show the available bounties and requirements.
Addon register the name and call up a function to screenshot the kill (with
possible hash and time verification to prevent false ones) and allow user to submit
the screenshot (after making sure the screenshot isn't showing something private)
Maybe direct DM in discord. Also could use combatlog pickup to send a hash by DM
to the user asking for bounty or a discord BOT that then auto rewards user by sending
message back to APP server.

Bounties could also be set against other guilds. Point system could be involved.
